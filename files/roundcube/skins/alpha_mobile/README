Alpha Mobile skin for Roundcube
===============================

Alpha Mobile is a Roundcube skin for smartphones and tablets. It is meant to be used with the accompanying plugins: rcs_mobile_options and rcs_mobile_switch. The plugins will allow the users to set different skins to be used on different device types and will select the skin automatically according to the device type used.

Roundcube compatibility
-----------------------

The skin has been tested and is fully compatible with Roundcube 0.9. It might not work properly on earlier or later versions of Roundcube.

Browser compatibility
---------------------

The skin is fully compatible with Safari for iPhone, iPod and iPad. It will also work on Windows Phone and Android devices, but since there are so many different device models running those operating systems and they have so many different browsers available, we can't guarantee that the skin will work properly on every combination of smartphone / operating system / browser.

Plugin support
--------------

Since most Roundcube plugins do not display their output properly on mobile devices, this skin does not provide a place for plugin buttons on the menus. The plugins will still load and function with this skin (for example, the filter plugin will still filter the mail and the blockquote plugin will still interact with the message text), but their option buttons will not be available. If you need to set any options for the additional plugins that you load, use a desktop device with a desktop skin where all those options are available.

Installation
------------

1. Install the skin:

Copy the directory "alpha_mobile" to the "skins" directory of your Roundcube.

2. Install the rcs plugins:

Copy the contents of the "plugins" directory (containing rcs_mobile_options and rcs_mobile_switch) from the installation package to the "plugins" directory of your Roundcube.

3. Set the skin as default:

Edit the file "config/main.inc.php", find a line that contains this variable: 

$rcmail_config['skin']

and add two new lines right after it:

$rcmail_config['tablet_skin'] = 'alpha_mobile';
$rcmail_config['phone_skin'] = 'alpha_mobile';

This will enable the mobile skin to be the default on tablets and smartphones. The individual users will be able set their personal skin preferences for tablets and smartphones in Settings -> User Interface.

4. Enable the rcs plugins:

Find the variable "plugins" in the file "config/main.inc.php" and add "rcs_mobile_options" and "rcs_mobile_switch" to the array, like this:

$rcmail_config['plugins'] = array("rcs_mobile_options", "rcs_mobile_switch");
